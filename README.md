# EventTrackerProject

## Repitition
Starting this project took a lot more creative thinking when it came to what to create. This was due to not wanting to have a massive idea that would take loads of work which might take away from the learning points of this project. I knew that with the new concept of technologies, I needed to get more repitition in than just something possibly cool, with this in mind I made this small project with many others to follow to gain the experience I need.
Having to start from JPA made this project fun for me because I would start from the complete beginning. I like that I would have to work on things I haven't done in a while and go all the way to the end. Making a POJO I could see that if you don't use it you lose it even with the simple topics. When I was trying to recall where to grab certain portions of the POJO it took a little while to remember, for example the Gradle tasks, it was located in Window/Show View/Other. Moving forward the project would piece together with quick key commands and then once I had my POJO, I made a test to make sure the project was connected to MySQL DB.
Once the test worked it was time to move into starting the REST API. This was the main portion of the project that I knew would take the most repitition to learn due to it being the structure of the project. Going through the simiar steps of the Xtreme project helped me understand the flow of structuring the project, going to a Controller, Service which is like the DAO, ServiceImpl like the DAOImpl and then the Repository if needed to do so. The Spring Data JPA is a great piece of technology which I saw when landing on trying to make code in the Repository. I learned that it isn't necessary to write CRUD formulas in the Repository you can implement the methods in the ServiceImpl. More to come about what I learned later.
